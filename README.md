# Page-Table

This program will demonstrate how a Page Table functions. Essentially, it takes a logical address, and then proceeds to convert the address into a physical address for the memory. The layout of the program
is such that it will generate 20 memory addresses, 3 given and 17 randomized, and will output the page number and block offset for each one of them!

## How to Build

Simply go into your working directory and use the command `g++ main.cpp -o main` to build this program. Then run the generated executable in a terminal to see the output!
